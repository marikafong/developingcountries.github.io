We strive to teach self-awareness and therefore broaden peopleâ€™s perspectives by educating the general public to the privileges we naturally have and consequently bringing light to the levels of poverty and disadvantages that are present in other underdeveloped countries. We created a game in addition to a website with data visuals to display this issue and further educate the world. We also included links to organizations that allow our users to donate and support people living in developing countries.
